A voice-based login system uses biometric authentication by analyzing a person's unique vocal features to verify identity, offering contactless and secure access. It works by enrolling the user's voice profile, typically using specific phrases or natural speech samples, which are then stored for future comparison. During login, the system extracts voice characteristics from a live audio sample and compares them with the stored profile. If the match meets a set threshold, access is granted; otherwise, it is denied. Voice-based login is used in banking, healthcare, and contact centers for its convenience and improved security over PINs and passwords. Advanced systems may use liveness detection to avoid spoofing and deepfake attacks. It is cost-effective and supports a seamless user experience across devices. The accuracy of such systems can be affected by background noise, short speech samples, or changes in the user's voice. Multi-factor authentication often pairs voice verification with other security measures for high-risk scenarios.
